#in this SQL I'm querying a database which contains multiple tables to quantify different statistics about customers, sales and order dates#

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
select count(OrderID) 
from BIT_DB.JanSales;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
select count(OrderID) 
from BIT_DB.JanSales 
where Product="iPhone";

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
select customers.acctnum
from BIT_DB.customers 
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON FebSales.orderID=customers.order_id;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
select distinct product, price
from BIT_DB.JanSales
where price in (select min(price) from BIT_DB.JanSales);
#OR 
SELECT distinct product, price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
select Product, sum(Quantity)*price as Revenue
from BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
select Product, Quantity, sum (Quantity)*price as Revenue
from BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location="548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
group by Product;


#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
select count(customers.acctnum), avg(FebSales.Quantity*FebSales.price) as spent
from BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderID=customers.order_id
where FebSales.Quantity>2;

#8List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
